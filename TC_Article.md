# Getting Work Done In a Chat Room

There's a growing trend within tech companies lately.

Regardless of their size and dispersement of workers, teams are moving their conversations away from traditional channels such as email and instant messaging and in to more collaborative environments like group chat.

The idea is simple really. Collaborating as a group to create conversations, build context, and share information about whats going on across technical and non-technical teams alike builds something that many teams overlook. 

Culture. 

Companies out there developing modern software and SaaS products have begun to adopt DevOps best practices to help get their product to market sooner. 

Anyone who has been a part of this shift in focus will tell you that DevOps isn't about tools or even processes. While those do play an important role, it's more about people and creating empathy within teams.

One way to create that empathy is to openly share everything that is going on. When conversations are no longer siloed and everyone can participate or collaborate over a subject or problem, a deeper understanding is had. An understanding about how things "get done" along with the challenges each specific teams faces

That empathy is at the heart of the DevOps movement which helps us to create a culture of automation, measurement, sharing, and learning.

Synchronous forms of group communication help to shorten feedback loops and provide situational awareness by creating an interface for workers from all business units to learn and share what's going on. And in many cases, teams are even automating the inclusion of context such as metrics, alerts, and documents right in to the body of the conversations already taking place.

Having "tribal knowledge" regarding not only the work getting done throughout our hectic day but also the conversations that relate to and surround our work is a huge boost in effeciency for teams. 

Today's modern group chat tools provide native 3rd-party integrations with many of the tools and services popular to most in the tech community.

In addition to the valuable context that is provided in line with the conversations, some teams have begun to implement what has been coined as ChatOps.
