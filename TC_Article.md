# Getting Work Done In a Chat Room

There's a growing trend within tech companies lately.

Regardless of their size and dispersement of workers, teams are moving their conversations away from traditional channels such as email and instant messaging and in to more collaborative environments like group chat.

The idea is simple really, collaborating as a group to have conversations, create context, and share information about whats going on in our daily work helps in a variety of ways. 

Those who are developing modern software and SaaS products have turned to the DevOps model to help get their product to market sooner. 

Anyone who has been a part of this shift in focus will tell you that DevOps isn't about tools or even processes. While those do play an important role, it's more about people and creating empathy within teams.

One way to create that empathy is to openly share everything that is going on. When conversations are no longer siloed and everyone can participate or collaborate over a subject or challenge, a deeper understanding is had surrounding the efforts taking place among varying teams in an organization.

That empathy is at the heart of the DevOps movement which helps us to create a culture of automation, measurement, learning, and sharing.

Synchronous forms of group communication help to shorten feedback loops and provide situational awareness by creating an interface for workers from all business units to learn and share what's going on. And in many cases, even automate the inclusion of context such as metrics right in to the conversation.

Having "tribal knowledge" regarding not only the work getting done throughout our hectic day but also the conversations that relate to and surround our work is a huge boost in effeciency for teams.
